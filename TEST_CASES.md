## Test 4: Pitch Feedback Loop (pitch-feedback-loop)

Run as a non-mod user, then as a mod, then back as the non-mod user.

| Step | Action | What to Check | Logs to Watch |
|------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| 4.1 | As non-mod, submit a pitch with title "Trivia night idea" and a 2-sentence description | Toast: "Idea received! 🎉 Mods will review it — check My Stuff for status." | `[PITCH] "Trivia night idea" by u/...` + `[PITCH] DM confirmation sent to u/...` |
| 4.2 | As non-mod, open 👤 → 💡 Pitches | Card shows: title, description, "📋 Pending review" (not "Status: pending") | `[MY-SUBMISSIONS]` includes the new pitch |
| 4.3 | As mod, open 🛡️ → 💡 Pitches | The new pitch is the active card. Card has [🗑️ Dismiss] button only (no "→ Event" or "Delete (old)" — those are out of scope for this change). | `[PITCHES] status=pending n=1 (counts pending=1 dismissed=0)` |
| 4.4 | As mod, click [🗑️ Dismiss] → confirm overlay opens with a Reason text input → type "Test dismiss" → tap Yes, Do It | Toast: "Idea dismissed". Card disappears from the pending view. A "🗑️ View dismissed (1)" link appears below the card. | `[DISMISS] Idea {id} soft-dismissed by u/{mod}: Test dismiss` |
| 4.5 | As mod, dismiss another pitch (or re-submit one) → in the reason prompt, leave the textarea EMPTY → tap Yes, Do It | Overlay stays open. The reason input is highlighted / not submitted. (Note: empty reason resolves to null and aborts the dismiss — no API call fires.) | — |
| 4.6 | As mod, click "🗑️ View dismissed (1)" | View switches to the dismissed tab. The dismissed pitch shows with status "❌ Dismissed: Test dismiss · on {today} · by u/{mod}". A "← Back to pending" link appears at the top. | `[PITCHES] status=dismissed n=1 (counts pending=1 dismissed=1)` |
| 4.7 | As mod, click "← Back to pending" | View returns to the pending tab. | `[PITCHES] status=pending n=1 (counts pending=1 dismissed=1)` |
| 4.8 | As non-mod (the original pitcher), open 👤 → 💡 Pitches → tap Next/Prev until the dismissed pitch is showing | Card shows: "❌ Dismissed: Test dismiss · on {today} · by u/{mod}". The [🗑️ Delete] button is still available (owner's hard-delete). | — |
| 4.9 | As non-mod, on the dismissed pitch, click [🗑️ Delete] → confirm | Toast: "Deleted". Card disappears. | `[DISMISS] Idea {id} hard-deleted by owner u/...` |
| 4.10 | As non-mod, refresh the page → 👤 → 💡 Pitches | The dismissed-and-deleted pitch is gone. Any surviving pitches still show the "📋 Pending review" line. | — |
| 4.11 | **pitch-dismiss-refresh** As mod, dismiss the only pending pitch in the queue → look at the empty state | Empty state shows "No pitched ideas" with a "🗑️ View dismissed (1)" link below. The link appears immediately (no tab switch / page refresh needed) — proves counts are refetched, not stale. | `[DISMISS]` log + `loadModTab` refetch + client log: `dismissIdea refetching pitches tab (was optimistic splice)` |
