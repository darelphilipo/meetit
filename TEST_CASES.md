## Test 3: Validation & Edge Cases

| Step | Action | What to Check | Logs to Watch |
|------|--------|---------------|---------------|
| 3.1 | Tap View Details → Step 4 → tap "🎟️ RSVP" → enter `not-an-email` → Confirm | Toast "Invalid email format", overlay stays open, **no server request** | client-side validation only |
| 3.2 | Tap ➕ → Create Event → Step 1: leave category as "Select category..." → Next | Toast "Select a category", stays on Step 1 | `eventNext` validation |
| 3.3 | Fill Step 1 properly → Step 2: set date = yesterday → complete → Submit | Toast "Event date must be today or in the future", no submit | client-side validation |
| 3.4 | (If possible) Open app with NO active events | Shows "🐱 Wow, so empty!" + "Tap ➕ to pitch an idea" | empty state render |
| 3.5 | Open any form (RSVP/Pitch/Event) → tap submit button rapidly 3x | Only 1 request fires, button shows loading state immediately | lock prevents duplicates |
| 3.6 | Switch to My Stuff tab with 0 items on all 3 tabs | Each tab shows empty-state graphic + CTA | empty state per tab |
| 3.7 | Open event details → Step 4 → tap RSVP → leave email+phone blank → Confirm | Should accept empty fields (optional), RSVP succeeds | `submitRsvp` / `[RSVP]` |
| 3.8 | Tap 👤 → My Events → remove pending event via earlier test → verify My Events tab now shows 0 | Empty state renders | `loadMySubmissions` |
| 3.9 | **(AUTH1 fix)** Verify RSVP/Leave require authentication: manually POST to `/api/rsvp` with empty/absent `context.username` | Server returns `401 Authentication required` | `[RSVP]` not logged (rejected before processing) |
| 3.10 | **(RAW1 fix)** Submit event, dismiss idea, delete event, approve event — verify ALL succeed with success toast (no false negatives from stale reads) | Every write action returns success. Logs show `[SUBMIT]`, `[DEL-*]`, `[APPROVE]`, `[DISMISS]` without `saved=` or `removed=` boolean fields | No `⚠️ FAILED` warnings in logs |
